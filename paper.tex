% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}

%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,

\begin{abstract}
%\boldmath
This research consider the Cauchy problem for quasilinear first-order equation in the case of non-monotonic initial function and arbitrary function of the state. Monotonic bicompact conservative numerical method, which approximates the traveling wave, without its explicit selection, was created. This method was used to verify the hypothesis formulated by Petrosyan N. This hypothesis describes the asymptotic behavior of the equation, as well as indicating the points of Maxwell, which "survive" after the decision becomes monotonous. Quasi-linear equations are used to simulate traffic flow problems and the theory of evolution of the universe, and many other problems. This numerical method can be used to solve these problems under the assumption of limitations.
\end{abstract}
% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway.

% Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.







% For peer review papers, you can put extra information on the cover
% page as needed:
% \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview

%
% For peerreview papers, this IEEEtran command inserts a page break and
% creates the second title. It will be ignored for other modes.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
We study the Cauchy problem for the equation 
\begin{gather}\label{1}
u_t+f_x(u) = 0,
\end{gather}
with initial data
\begin{gather}\label{2}
u(0,x) = u_0(x).
\end{gather}

We introduce the following notation:
\begin{gather*}
U_0(y) = \int\limits_{0}^{y}u_0(x)dx, \\
U_0^*(p) = \sup_{y \in R^1}(py-U_0(y)).
\end{gather*}

We assume that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $f'' (u)$ has only isolated zeros on $R^1$.
	\item $u_0(x) \equiv u^{-}$ if $x<A$, $u_0(x) \equiv u^{+}$ if $x>B$, $u^{-}\neq u^{+}$.
	\item the solution $u(t,x)$ of the problem (\ref{1},\ref{2}) is piecewise smooth function on $\bar{\Pi}^{+}$.
\end{enumerate}

In paper \cite{petrosyan} the behavior of $u(t,x)$ on $t\rightarrow +\infty$ with arbitrary function $f(u)$ and $u_0(x)\in (u^{-},u^{+})$ if $x\in (A,B)$ was considered.

Without loss of generality we may assume that $u^{-}<u^{+}$.

The function $U_0^*(p)$ is the Legendre transform of non-convex function $U_0(y)$ and it is convex. We suppose that the graph of the function $F(p)$ matches with the convex hull of the graph  $f(p)$ on $[u^{-},u^{+}]$. The graph $F(p)\in C^1([u^{-},u^{+}])$ consists of a finite number of arcs of the graph $f(p)$ and a finite number of segments tangential to the graph $f(p)$. Let 
$$x_i = \frac{U_0^*(u_{i+1})-U_0^*(u_i)}{u_{i+1}-u_i},\, i = 1, \ldots, m-1,$$ where $u_2 < u_3< \ldots < u_{m-1},\, u_1 = u^{-},\, u_m = u^{+}$ is interior points of contact.

Let \begin{gather*}
\widetilde{u}_0 = u_1\chi_{(-\infty,x_1)}(x)+u_2\chi_{(x_1,x_2)}(x)+\\
+\ldots+u_m\chi_{(x_{m-1},\infty)}(x),
\end{gather*}
where  $\chi_{(a,b)}$  is the characteristic function of the interval $(a,b)$.

Let  $\widetilde{u} (t,x)$ be generalized solution of the Cauchy problem for the equation (\ref{1},\ref{2}), where $f(u)$ is replaced by $F(u)$, and $u(0,x) = \widetilde{u}_0(x)$.

\newtheorem{Hyp}{Hypothesis}
\begin{Hyp}\label{3} (Petrosyan\cite{petrosyan},p.213-214)
	
We suppose that conditions 1), 2), 3) are assumed to be right and $ u_0 (x) \in (u ^ {-}, u ^ {+}) $ at $ x \in (A, B) $. Let the lines $ \widetilde {x} = k_jt + b_j, \, j = 1, \ldots, N $, be the shock waves of the solution $ \widetilde {u} (t, x) $. Each shock wave $ \widetilde {x}_j (t) $ such that $ \widetilde {u} (t, \widetilde {x} _j (t) \pm 0) = u_j ^ {\pm} \in \{u_1, \ldots, u_m \} $ corresponds to a shock wave $ x_j (t) = k_jt + b_j + a_j (t) $ in $ u (t, x) $, where $ a_j (t) \rightarrow0, \, u (t, x_j (t) \pm0) \rightarrow u_j ^ {\pm} $ at $ t \rightarrow + \infty $. All other shockwaves $ x = x (t), \, t \in [t_0, + \infty) $, are weak, ie, $ U (t, x (t) +0) -u (t, x (t) -0) \rightarrow0 $ at $ t \rightarrow + \infty $.
\end{Hyp}

\section{Description of the numerical method}

The main feature of the equation is the possibility of discontinuous solutions, even with smooth boundary conditions. Pass-through accounts (homogeneous difference schemes) in which discontinuous numerical solutions computed without explicitly highlight gaps are widely used in these equations.

We consider the mixed Cauchy problem for the quasilinear hyperbolic equation which is written in the divergence form:
\begin{gather}\label{4}
u_t+f_x(u)=0,\, a(u) = \frac{df(u)}{du}>0,\\
u(x,0) = u^0(x),\, x\geq0;\\
u(0,t) = \mu(t),\, t>0.
\end{gather}

We take the uniform grid $\{x_j,\, j\geq0\}$ on $[0,\infty)$and integrate the equation (\ref{4}) on $x_j\leq x\leq x_{j+1}$:
\begin{gather*}\label{5}
(\bar{u}_{j+1})_t = -\frac{f_{j+1}-f_j}{h}, \, f_j = f(u_j),\, \\
h = x_{j+1}-x_j,\, j\geq 0,
\end{gather*}
where $\bar{u}_{j+1}$ is cumulative average of function $u(x,t)$ on $[x_j,x_{j+1}]$:
\begin{gather}\label{8}
\bar{u}_{j+1} = \frac{1}{h}\int\limits_{x_j}^{x_{j+1}}u dx.
\end{gather}

Further, we use the formulas of Simpson and Maclaurin and exclude  the values in the non-integer nodes from the system. Finally we get the monotone conservative implicit Euler scheme:
\begin{gather*}\label{11}
\bar{u}_{j+1}^{n+1}+r(f(u_{j+1}^{n+1})-f(u_j^{n+1})) = \bar{u}_{j+1}^n,\, j\geq 0,\\
\frac{1}{4}(u_{j+1}^{n+1}-u_j^{n+1})+rf(u_{j+1}^{n+1})-\\
-2rf\left(\frac{3}{2}\bar{u}_{j+1}^{n+1}-\frac{1}{4}u_{j+1}^{n+1}-\frac{1}{4}u_{j}^{n+1}\right)+
\\+rf(u_j^{n+1}) = \frac{1}{4}(u_{j+1}^n-u_{j}^{n}).\label{12}
\end{gather*}

\section{The result of numerical method}
We analyze the results of the program and compare it with the conclusions of the Petrosyan's hypothesis.
Let 
\begin{gather*}
f(x) = -0.002 x^6+0.0736x^5- 1.0881x^4+\\

In this case Maxwell's points are the intersections of lines $ u = 7.1091 $ and $ u = 8.8052 $ with the decision $ u (t, x) $. Points $ u = 7.1091 $ and $ u = 8.8052 $ are the  $ u_2 $ and $ u_3 $ points from Petrosyan's hypothesis. The hypothesis states that after a while, when the decision becomes monotonous, two points with initial time coordinates $ x_i = \argmax \limits_ {y} (u_iy-U_0 (y)), \, i = 1,2$ will remain. The tables with values $ (u_iy-U_0 (y)) $ that correspond to the Maxwell's points:

\section{Conclusion}

We consider the Cauchy problem for quasilinear first-order equation in the case of non-monotonic initial function and arbitrary function of the state. The monotonic bicompact conservative numerical method, which approximates the traveling wave, without its explicit selection was built. With it we test the hypothesis formulated by N. Petrosyan. This hypothesis describes the asymptotic behavior of the equation, as well as indicates the points of Maxwell, which "survive" after the decision becomes monotonous. Quasi-linear equations are used in simulation traffic problem, in the theory of evolution of the universe, and others. This numerical method allows us to solve this problems.
